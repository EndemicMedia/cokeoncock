This is the "Streetwear Menu" for Europe. I have compiled this by cross-referencing the catalogs of **Printful** (Latvia/Spain facilities), **Printify** (German/Polish providers), and **Shirtee** (Cologne-based, excellent for Germany).

For a streetwear brand, **fabric weight (GSM)** and **fit** are everything. Standard merch is 150 GSM; Streetwear is 200+ GSM.

### **1. TOPS: The "Oversized & Heavy" Collection**
*The core of your brand. Do not use standard Gildan Softstyle here.*

| Item Type | Best "Streetwear" Model | Specs | Provider Availability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oversized Tee** | **Stanley/Stella Fuser (STTU759)** | Relaxed fit, dropped shoulders, organic. | **Printify** (Provider: Textildruck Europa - DE) |
| **Heavyweight Tee** | **Stanley/Stella Sparker (STTU171)** | 220 GSM (Very thick), rougher "dry" handfeel. | **Printful**, **Shirtee**, **Printify** |
| **Luxury Tee** | **Stanley/Stella Freestyler (STTU788)** | 240 GSM (Super heavy), oversized, premium feel. | **Printify** (Provider: Textildruck Europa), **Shirtee** |
| **Boxy Hoodie** | **Stanley/Stella Slammer (STSU856)** | 350 GSM, no drawstrings (clean look), oversized. | **Shirtee**, **Printify** |
| **Zip-Up Hoodie** | **Stanley/Stella Cultivator (STSU875)** | 350 GSM, metal zipper, premium finish. | **Printify**, **Shirtee** |
| **Crewneck** | **Stanley/Stella Radder (STSU866)** | Oversized, relaxed crewneck, 350 GSM. | **Printify** |

> **Pro Tip:** **Shirtee.com** (based in Cologne) allows you to print on the *neck* (inside label) and *sleeve* on many of these items, which is crucial for branding.

### **2. BOTTOMS: Joggers & Shorts**
*Streetwear bottoms are hard in POD because fit is tricky. Stick to these safe bets.*

| Item Type | Model / Style | Fit Description | Provider Availability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Joggers** | **Stanley/Stella Mover (STBM569)** | 300 GSM, medium fit (not too baggy), matching hoodie colors. | **Printful**, **Printify** |
| **Sweat Shorts** | **Stanley/Stella Trainer (STBM568)** | Heavy cotton shorts, raw edge options sometimes available. | **Shirtee**, **Printify** |
| **Leggings** | **All-Over Print (Cut & Sew)** | You design the fabric, they sew it. Polyester/Spandex. | **Printful** (Best quality sewing in EU) |

---

### **3. HEADWEAR: The "Details"**
*Caps are high-margin items. Embroidery is the only way to go here (printing on caps looks cheap).*

| Item Type | Style Name | Technique | Provider Availability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dad Hat** | **Beechfield B653** or **Cotton Heritage** | Unstructured, curved visor, metal buckle. | **Printful** (Offers 3D Puff), **Printify** |
| **Fisherman Beanie** | **Beechfield B44** | "Trawler" style (short fit, sits above ears). Very trendy in Berlin/London. | **Printful**, **Printify** |
| **Bucket Hat** | **Flexfit 5003** | Classic bucket shape. | **Printful** (Best embroidery quality) |
| **Trucker Cap** | **Retro Trucker** | Mesh back, foam front. | **Printful**, **Shirtee** |

> **Crucial:** Only **Printful** offers **3D Puff Embroidery** (raised stitching) in Europe. If you want that "Supreme/Stussy" logo look on a cap, you must use Printful.

---

### **4. ACCESSORIES: Cross-Sell Items**
*Small items to add to the cart.*

| Item Type | Model | Notes | Provider Availability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tote Bag** | **Stanley/Stella Tote** | 300 GSM (Heavy canvas). Avoid the cheap 140 GSM bags. | **Printify**, **Shirtee** |
| **Socks** | **Embroidered Crew Socks** | White/Black ribbed socks with a small embroidered logo. | **Printful** (Very popular streetwear item) |
| **Phone Cases** | **Tough Case** | Double-layer (silicone + plastic). High perceived value. | **Printify** (Provider: Prodigi UK/EU), **Shirtee** |
| **Fanny Pack** | **All-Over Print Waist Bag** | Custom printed fabric, sewn to order. | **Printful** |

### **Summary of Service Strategy for Europe**

1.  **Use Shirtee (Germany) or Printify (Textildruck Europa)** for your **Main Apparel** (Hoodies/Tees). They have the best access to *Stanley/Stella* stock, which is the fabric your customers actually want.
2.  **Use Printful (Latvia/Spain)** for **Headwear & Accessories**. Their embroidery quality is superior, and they have unique items like the "Embroidered Socks" and "3D Puff Hats" that the others lack.

**Immediate Next Step:**
Go to **Shirtee.com** and **Printify.com**, search for **"Stanley Stella Freestyler"** (Heavy Tee) and **"Stanley Stella Slammer"** (Heavy Hoodie). These two items will form the foundation of your luxury streetwear line.


If you want to expand beyond streetwear while keeping the same production partners (Printful, Printify, Shirtee), here is the **"Non-Streetwear" Product Menu**.

These categories work best for niches like **fitness, corporate branding, eco-conscious buyers, and family gifts**.

### **1. ACTIVEWEAR (Gym & Yoga)**
*Streetwear is about loose cotton; Activewear is about tight synthetic "performance" fabrics.*

| Item Type | Best Model / Style | Why it Sells | Best Provider (EU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Leggings** | **All-Over Print (Cut & Sew)** | You design the fabric, they sew it. High margin item. | **Printful** (Best quality sewing in Latvia/Spain) |
| **Sports Bra** | **Padding Sports Bra** | Matches the leggings. Padded options are perceived as higher value. | **Printful** |
| **Rash Guard** | **Long Sleeve Performance Top** | Tight fit for surfers/MMA. High perceived value. | **Printful** |
| **Tech Tee** | **Just Cool JC001** | 100% Polyester, moisture-wicking. Cheap but functional. | **Printify** (Textildruck Europa), **Shirtee** |

### **2. WORKWEAR (Business & Uniforms)**
*Focus on durability and embroidery. Printing on these looks cheap; always use embroidery.*

| Item Type | Best Model / Style | Why it Sells | Best Provider (EU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apron** | **Organic Cotton Apron** | Huge for cafes/barbers. One size fits all (no returns issues). | **Printful**, **Shirtee** |
| **Polo Shirt** | **Gildan 64800** or **Stanley/Stella Prepster** | The corporate standard. The "Prepster" is the premium organic option. | **Printful** (Embroidery), **Printify** |
| **Work Vest** | **Result Core Bodywarmer** | Padded vest for outdoor workers/events. High utility. | **Printify** (Check German providers) |

### **3. KIDS & BABY (The "Mini-Me" Market)**
*Parents spend money easily on matching sets. Organic is a huge selling point here.*

| Item Type | Best Model / Style | Why it Sells | Best Provider (EU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Baby Body** | **Organic Bodysuit (Short Sleeve)** | "Onesie". Essential baby gift item. | **Shirtee**, **Printful** |
| **Baby Bib** | **Contrast Trim Bib** | Easy upsell item (cheap add-on). | **Printful**, **Shirtee** |
| **Kids Hoodie** | **Stanley/Stella Mini Cruiser** | Matches the adult "Cruiser" hoodie for "Parent & Me" sets. | **Printify**, **Shirtee** |

### **4. ECO-FRIENDLY & SUSTAINABLE**
*Europeans care deeply about this. If you market "Sustainable," use ONLY these specific items.*

| Item Type | Best Model / Style | Why it Sells | Best Provider (EU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eco Tote** | **Econscious Organic Cotton Tote** | The "Berlin standard" tote bag. Very sturdy. | **Printify**, **Printful** |
| **Organic Tee** | **Stanley/Stella Creator (STTU755)** | The absolute standard for organic cotton tees in Europe. Soft & retail quality. | **All Providers** |
| **Recycled Tee** | **Salvage SA60** | Made from recycled plastic bottles & cotton clippings. Great marketing story. | **Printify** (Textildruck Europa) |

### **5. LOUNGEWEAR & UNDERWEAR**
*Great for holiday gifts (Christmas/Valentine's).*

| Item Type | Best Model / Style | Why it Sells | Best Provider (EU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Socks** | **All-Over Print / Embroidery** | "Face on socks" or logo socks. High impulse buy. | **Printful** (Best socks in the game) |
| **Boxers** | **AOP Boxer Briefs** | Funny gift item. You design the whole fabric. | **Printify**, **Printful** |
| **Robes** | **All-Over Print Robe** | Luxury lounging. Very unique POD item. | **Printful** |

### **Recommendation Strategy**
*   **If you want to do "Everything":** Use **Printful**. They have the widest range of niche categories (Leggings, Aprons, Bean Bags, Socks) produced in-house in Europe (Latvia/Spain).
*   **If you want to do "Corporate/Teamwear":** Focus on **Embroidery** on Polos and Aprons. Printful is safer for embroidery digitization quality.
*   **If you want to do "Sustainable Basics":** Stick to **Printify** or **Shirtee** and filter strictly for the brand **Stanley/Stella**. They have the best colors and matching sets for Men/Women/Kids.
